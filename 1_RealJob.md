# **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for Thanos and Helm Chart Testing Project ðŸš€**

## **Objective 1: Successfully Deploy Thanos using Bitnami Helm Charts**  
This objective focuses on achieving a smooth, repeatable deployment of Thanos within Kubernetes using Helm.

### **Key Results**:
- KR1: Complete Thanos installation in the Kubernetes cluster in under 30 minutes.
- KR2: Validate the installation by ensuring all Thanos components (query, store, receive, etc.) are running and accessible via `kubectl`.
- KR3: Achieve a 100% success rate in deployment with no Helm chart-related errors across at least 3 different Kubernetes environments (e.g., Minikube, OpenShift, and Codespaces).

---

## **Objective 2: Ensure Stability and Performance of Thanos in Monitoring Setup**  
This objective ensures Thanos is fully integrated and functioning well within the monitoring-testing namespace.

### **Key Results**:
- KR1: Configure Thanos to be fully operational with less than 2% downtime during testing.
- KR2: Run a minimum of 10 basic and advanced tests (using `kubectl logs`, `get pods`, etc.) without any critical errors.
- KR3: Monitor and analyze logs using Loki, ensuring less than 10 error logs per day in the `monitoring-testing-october24` namespace.

---

## **Objective 3: Validate Load Balancer & Port Forwarding**  
This objective focuses on ensuring smooth user interaction through the UI and testing the load balancer and forwarding configuration.

### **Key Results**:
- KR1: Successfully access Thanos Query UI through port forwarding on at least 3 different environments (Codespaces, Minikube, OpenShift).
- KR2: Validate the load balancer setup and ensure it forwards traffic correctly to Thanos Query with a response time of < 300ms.
- KR3: Test the route configurations and validate frontend access on OpenShift and Minikube environments.

---

## **Objective 4: Implement Security and Certificate Management**  
This objective ensures that the deployed Thanos instance is secure with proper certificate management.

### **Key Results**:
- KR1: Install certificates for secure access to Thanos services in all testing environments (Minikube, OpenShift, Codespaces).
- KR2: Ensure that all services are accessible over HTTPS with valid certificates, verified using `kubectl get svc`.
- KR3: Conduct security tests and confirm no critical vulnerabilities in the Thanos deployment within the first two weeks post-deployment.
