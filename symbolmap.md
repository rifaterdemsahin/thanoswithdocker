Hereâ€™s how you can represent a Minikube setup with Docker, including Thanos components, using Mermaid syntax:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Minikube] -->|Runs| B[Docker]

    subgraph Prometheus Setup
        B --> C[Prometheus]
        C --> D[Thanos Sidecar]
        D --> E[Thanos Store]
        D --> F[Thanos Query]
        D --> G[Thanos Compact]
    end

    subgraph Object Storage
        E --> H[Storage Bucket S3]
        G --> H
    end

    F --> H
    F --> I[Thanos Querier UI]
```

### Explanation:
- **Minikube** runs the **Docker** engine, which manages containers.
- **Prometheus** is running inside Docker and collects metrics.
- **Thanos Sidecar** attaches to Prometheus, allowing data to be shipped and queried across long-term storage.
- **Thanos Store** and **Thanos Compact** handle object storage and data compaction.
- The **Thanos Query** component serves queries across different Prometheus instances, and its output can be visualized using the **Thanos Querier UI**.
- The **Storage Bucket (S3/GCS)** represents an external object storage system used by Thanos for long-term data storage.
